  title: Mona Lisa
  author: Leonardo da Vinci
  description: "The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist
    Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance,
    \rit has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written
    about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world\". \rThe
    painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, the monumentality
    of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism."
  location: Louvre, Paris
